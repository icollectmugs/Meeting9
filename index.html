        <p>Surabaya. An earthquake with a magnitude of 6.1 rocked several areas in East Java, including Tuban and Gresik Regencies, as well as Surabaya City. As a result of the tremors, several infrastructure buildings on Bawean Island suffered severe damage, but fortunately, no casualties have been reported so far.</p>

        <p>Among the damaged infrastructures on Bawean Island, the As Sholihin Muhammadiyah Mosque in Kotakusuma Village, Sangkapura District, was significantly affected. The mosque's walls cracked, and parts of it collapsed due to the earthquake.</p>

        <p>Local resident Kikin said the mosque, which was damaged by the earthquake, is no longer functional. Hence, there were no casualties as the building debris fell.<br><br>

            "That mosque is an old building that was affected. It is no longer used for prayers and worship because there is already a new mosque being built," he explained on Friday.</p>
